This repository doesn't contain any compiled files, and therefore source code downloads must be compiled before use. The compiled addon is available through the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2279547474), and will remain hosted there, as the files are too large to be hosted by GitHub.
